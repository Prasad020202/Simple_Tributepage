		<h2>Early life and Childhood</h2>
		<p>Pichai Sundararajan, more commonly known to us as Sundar Pichai was born in Madurai, in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, on July 12, 1972. He belongs to a lower middle-class family and had never experienced the luxury of watching television or traveling by car in his childhood.</p>
		<p>His father Raghunath Pichai  worked as an Electrical Engineer in General Electric in Chennai and therefore, the family lived in the city, at Ashok Nagar. His father was the manager of a factory that made components for electrical objects. The stories of the work challenges faced by his father always inspired Pichai.</p>
		<p>His mother, Lakshmi, was a Stenographer until she gave birth to her kids. Sundar has a younger brother as well. Pichai saw technology in his hands at the age of 12 when his father bought a land line phone for the house. He had an extraordinary skill of memorizing and remembering numbers.  He could keep in mind all the numbers he dialed. Pichai was not only good with numbers whilst at school but also the captain of his high school cricket team.</p>
